# XpsToPdf

This is a fork of [XpsToPdf/XpsToPdf](https://github.com/XpsToPdf/XpsToPdf) which completely removes WPF and Windows dependency.

A single package to convert XPS to PDF.

Based on [PdfSharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/) and Nathan Jones work, see his [blog post](https://nathanpjones.com/2013/03/output-to-pdf-in-wpf-for-free/) to see how to use XpsToPdf.
